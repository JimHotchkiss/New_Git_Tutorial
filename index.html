<!-- > git clone "url.git" will clone repository (another name
        for a profject) to your local machine.  Make sure you
        save to the file you want.
      > git status will show you what is different between the
        code you have on your machine, and the code in the repository
        > git add (you can [git add .] or you can [git add "specif
        file"]).
          > git status will show the work or file that was once red,
            now it is green, and it's been added to the repository
            (project)  Now!  The file needs to be commited
            >git commit -m "notes about what you did" now it's commited
             but it's still locked on my machine, it's not syched up to
             github yet.
             >git push this will "push" all the changes that we've commited
              up to github.  If you go to the repository (and refresh), you
              will see all the new work that has been added.
So, git push, pushes files up to the repository, and git pull, pulss down
the files (make sure you are in the right directory)
